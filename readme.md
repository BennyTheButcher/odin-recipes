My current project is title "Project: Recipes". Essentially, I am going to be using the tools that I have learned over this current module and put them into use. I will be building a basic recipe website. How exciting. When I am done, I can look back at this project and say that I utilized visual code to create HTML and also, I can say that I am more confident in working out of terminal.
