        <h3>Your traditional scrambled eggs, but with a cheesy kick!</h3>
        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>¼ cup cheddar cheese, grated (or Monterey Jack)</li>
            <li>½ tsp olive oil (or butter)</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            
        </ul>
        <h4>Follow these steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Put a frying pan onto a medium heat and put in the butter or oil.</li>
            <li>Break the eggs into a bowl and beat quickly with a fork.</li>
            <li>Grate the cheese and have it ready.</li>
            <li>Tip the beaten eggs into the frying pan.</li>
            <li>Layer the cheese on top.</li>
            <li>The eggs will start to solidify almost straight away,as soon as they do use a spatula and ‘pull’ the eggs in from the side to the middle.</li>
            <li>Repeat the pulling in several times.</li>
            <li>It doesn’t take long, the idea behind this is you’ll have soft, lightly cooked fresh eggs. It’s hard to undercook an egg really, but very easy to overcook. 2 – 3 minutes cooking time is all you’ll need.</li>
            <li>When the egg has no ‘watery’ bits left, you’re done! Quickly remove from heat and transfer to plate – preferably on top of some lovely, hot, unbuttered bread.</li>
            <li>Add some salt and pepper to taste. Done!</li>
</ol>
